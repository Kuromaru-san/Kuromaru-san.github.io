        ・People who post sexually explicit media of their real bodies, whether they still do or are retired, DO NOT INTERACT.<br>
        &nbsp;Ero-drawing artists and R18 Vtubers are fine. If you're a VTuber and still post sexually explicit media of your<br>
        &nbsp;real body, DO NOT INTERACT. People who post lewd imagery of their real body, but not necessarily R18 (such as Fefe)<br>
        &nbsp;are fine. If anyone sees that I'm following someone who posts sexually explicit media of their real body, that means<br>
        &nbsp;I'm unaware that they do that. In such a case, <b>please let me know. For the record, I do not know if I would say<b><br>
     <b>&nbsp;that I'm really anti against real porn.</b> It's just something that makes me uncomfortable and it's difficult for me<br>
        &nbsp;to stomach, so just know that I am constantly on a blocking spree to those who post sexually explicit media of their<br>
        &nbsp;real bodies. It's just what they do puts me at a discomfort.<br>
        &nbsp;By the way, "Vtubers" that do this with their real bodies<br> are not welcome in the Vtuber community in my eyes.<br>
          <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though I won't attack people simply for doing this kind of thing, I won't hold back on pointing it out in an</b><br>
          <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arguement if they are being toxic and hypocritical.</b><br>
          <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bare nipples, even if barely visible, count as sexually explicit media. Areola is questionable. Visible vagina muscle or</b><br>
          <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fat counts as sexually explicit media.</b><br><br>


        ・Antis who are so expressive of their hate toward lolicons, shotacons, or weebs that they will go out of their way to<br>
        　attack them, DO NOT INTERACT. If you don't like those tropes, fine. Go somewhere else, don't harass. If you can at<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        least follow those rules, you may interact.<br><br>

        ・Sexual predators, rapists, pedophiles, MAPs, PEARs, sex offenders, <b>DO NOT INTERACT!</b>
        
        <br><br>・Toxic bullies, Abusers, <b>DO NOT INTERACT!</b><br><br>
        　I shall update this list at a later date.
