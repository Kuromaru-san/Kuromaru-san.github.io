        <b>DNI List:</b><br><br>
        ・People who post sexually explicit media of their real bodies, DO NOT INTERACT. Ero-drawing artists and R18<br>
        　Vtubers are fine. If you're a VTuber and still post sexually explicit media of your real body, DO NOT INTERACT.<br>
        　People who post lewd imagery of their real body, but not necessarily R18 (such as Fefe) are fine. If anyone sees<br>
        　that I'm following someone who posts sexually explicit media of their real body, that means I'm unaware that they do<br>
        　that. In such a case, <b>please let me know. For the record, I'm not really anti against real porn.</b> It's just something<br>
        　that makes me uncomfortable and it's difficult for me to stomach, so just know that I am constantly on a blocking spree<br>
        　to those who post sexually explicit media of their real bodies. It's just what they do puts me at a discomfort. People<br>
          People who used to post sexually excplicit media of themselves but have retired, such as Shibuya Kaho will not beblocked,<br>
          but will not be followed either. If anyone notices that I follow someone who used to do such a thing, I do not know that<br>
        　that they used to do that. <b>In such a case, please let me know.</b><br>
          <b>Even though I won't attack people simply for doing this kind of thing, I won't hold back on pointing it out if they are</b><br>
          <b>toxic and hypocritical.</b>
          <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bare nipples, even if barely visible, count as sexually explicit media. Areola is questionable. Visible vagina muscle or</b><br>
          <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fat counts as sexually explicit media.</b><br><br>


        ・Antis who are so expressive of their hate toward lolicons, shotacons, or weebs that they will go out of their way to<br>
        　attack them, DO NOT INTERACT. If you don't like those tropes, fine. Go somewhere else, don't harass. If you can at<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        least follow those rules, you may interact.<br><br>

        ・Sexual predators, rapists, pedophiles, sex offenders, <b>DO NOT INTERACT!</b>
        
        ・Toxic bullies, Abusers, <b>DO NOT INTERACT!</b><br><br>
        　I shall update this list at a later date.
